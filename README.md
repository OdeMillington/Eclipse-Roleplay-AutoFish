# Eclipse-Roleplay-AutoFish
This program automatically catches fish in Eclipse Roleplay GTA V server.
It uses optical character reader modules to accomplish this.  It reads the top of the screen and checks for
the keywords in which the server displays then it automatically presses "K" and opens the inventory and pulls the fishing rod back out.
